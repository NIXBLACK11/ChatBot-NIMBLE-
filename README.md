README for NIMBLE Chatbot
Overview
NIMBLE is a Python-based chatbot that uses advanced facial recognition technology to provide an enhanced user experience with an added layer of security. It can understand a wide variety of inputs from the user and provide responses in both text and audio formats. NIMBLE can store daily tasks based on the user's identity and retrieve them upon detecting the user's face.
